This is the git repo for the Smart Odisha Hackhathon,2022 conducted by Government of India. 
We were working on the problem statement 'Housing and Urban,Smart City'. We have prepared an App through which a resident can request garbage collection of garbage, track garbage collectors as well as get notified when a collector passes-by. We integrated our Application with a ML model created by us for proper and accurate segregation of garbage.
